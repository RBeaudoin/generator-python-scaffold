A [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator for creating a setuptools based python module
====================================================================================

Overview
--------
Yeoman generators are used to scaffold out projects of all types and languages, you can learn more about them [here](http://yeoman.io/). This generator will scaffold out a python module that can be installed with [setuptools](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools). By following the command prompts, it will create a setup customized for your specific purposes. 

Installation
------------
In order to use this generator, you'll, need to have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) installed. [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) is a useful tool fo installing versions of Node.js and [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/). 

Once Node.js is installed, install yeoman by running ```npm install -g yeoman```. Once that is done, clone this repo, switch to the root directory, and run ```npm link```. With this completed, you can run ```yo generator-python``` in a directory to scaffold out a Python application. 

Future releases will be deployed to, and made available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/)
